# customizable-dashboard

#### This small project is written in ES6 without any transpilers and therefore it only works in chrome browsers.

- if you care to play with the code just clone the repo and then start a server (i reccomend live-server which can be installed via npm) and play with the different customizable elements.
- a live version can be found at [customizable-dashboard](https://emilmircea.github.io/customizable-dashboard/)
